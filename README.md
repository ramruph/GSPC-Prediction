# GSPC-Prediction
S&amp;P500 Stock Prediction
# Overview
In this project to use the S&P500 data, a Linear Regression, and a Random Forest Ensemble Supervised Learning Model to predict the overall Stock Market and if tomorrow's price will go up or down in direction.

I choose to use the s&p500 data because the S&P500 index is a representation of the top 500 companies in the United States and represents the state of the US Economy.

This will allow for a better understanding of the potential direction the markets are in and allow me or someone else to use this data to guide invesment strategies and assess risk for investors.
